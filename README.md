# Sunlight spectra for photoelectrochemistry

With functions for calculating photon flux, current density, and solar-to-hydrogen
efficiency based on either the ASTM G173-03 reference spectrum (AM1.5G) or
on the black-body radiation (Planck theory), for relevant wavelength range.

This R package also includes a dataframe of some relevant solar constants.
